# Expense Tracker - MERN (MySQL)

Node & Express Application using MySQL.

I have developed CRUD operations using MySQL, and MongoDB also. The codes for MongoDB is commented out.

Update: Performed All the operations using ORM (Sequelize) for MySQL.

This project has 3 different kinds of implementations: 
  - Node application with MongoDB using Mongoose as ODM.
  - Node application with MySQL using 'mysql' dependency (Writing MySQL queries.)
  - Node application with MySQL using Sequelize as ORM.
